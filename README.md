This is an experimental version of the V package manager, 
that will be available with commands, like this:
`v pm2 install URL`
`v pm2 add DEPENDENCY_NAME`
`v pm2 run URL`
`v pm2 login`
`v pm2 publish`
etc.

At some point, when it is mature enough,
the intention is that it will replace the existing package manager.
